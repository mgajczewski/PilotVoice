# PilotVoice MVP Application

## Main Problem
In the paragliding environment, there is a lack of information about competitions across different aspects. Without feedback from participants, it is difficult to draw systemic conclusions for the future. Providing feedback is currently formally difficult and cumbersome for competitors.

## Minimum Viable Functionality
- Filling out a survey evaluating various aspects of competitions
- Optional question sections for those interested
- Automatic progress saving
- Verification of open-ended question answers for GDPR compliance
- Simple user account system for completing surveys, open for future integration with external authentication services
- Opening and closing surveys for competitions by moderators
- Simple page for moderators with a summary of collected data

## What is NOT Included in the MVP
- Automatic creation of surveys through integration with the official competition calendar
- Integration of the user account system with external authentication services
- Notification system for surveys to be completed or updated
- Integration with a system for reporting safety incidents
- Advanced analysis of collected data
- Communication between moderators and participants to clarify collected situations
- Verification of user participation in evaluated competitions
- Translation

## Success Criteria
- At least 50% of competitors complete the survey after the competition
- At least 75% of surveys with mandatory fields completed in under 3 minutes
- At least 25% of surveys with any optional field completed
- Less than 5% of surveys abandoned without completing all mandatory fields
