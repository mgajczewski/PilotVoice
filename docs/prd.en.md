# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - PilotVoice MVP

## 1. Product overview

PilotVoice is a web application dedicated to the paragliding community, whose goal is to systematically collect feedback from competition participants. The application allows pilots to fill in standardized surveys evaluating various aspects of the competition. On the other hand, moderators (e.g., competition organizers) receive access to a panel with aggregated, anonymous data, which enables analysis and drawing conclusions to improve the quality of future events. The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focuses on creating a simple yet fully functional tool to achieve this basic goal, postponing more advanced features such as integrations with external systems or automation.

## 2. User problem

Within the paragliding community, there is a clear lack of an effective channel for providing feedback on how competitions are conducted. Without systematically collecting opinions from participants, it is difficult for organizers and supervising organizations to identify areas requiring improvement and to make data-driven decisions. Current methods of submitting comments are often burdensome for competitors and inefficient, leading to the loss of valuable insights and preventing systematic improvement of paragliding competition organization in the future.

## 3. Functional requirements

### 3.1. User Management
-   Registration process based on email and password, secured with a "captcha" mechanism.
-   Ability to log in and maintain a user session ("remember me").
-   Two roles in the system: `User` (pilot) and `Moderator`.
-   A `Super Admin` account to manually grant and revoke `Moderator` privileges.
-   A simple user profile page with the ability to manage the password and add a CIVL ID number or a textual reason for registration.
-   The user must complete the profile (CIVL ID or reason) after filling in the first survey, before starting the next one.

### 3.2. Survey Filling Process (for Pilot)
-   Access to surveys via unique, simple URL links (and QR codes).
-   Within the MVP there is one standard survey template.
-   Survey progress is saved automatically.
-   Survey statuses: `started` (started), `completed` (mandatory fields completed), `abandoned` (abandoned).
-   A survey is considered `abandoned` if the mandatory fields are not filled within a configurable period (e.g., 1 hour).
-   Answers to open-ended questions are automatically processed by AI to remove personal data (GDPR compliance). The user sees their original content and the AI suggestion, but only the corrected version is stored in the system.
-   After completing all mandatory fields, the user is redirected to a thank-you page and encouraged to fill in optional questions and complete the profile.
-   The user can return to a survey with status `completed` to edit or add answers to optional questions until the survey is closed by a moderator.
-   Data from `abandoned` surveys are stored for analytical purposes.

### 3.3. Survey Management and Moderator Panel
-   Moderators can create surveys for specific competitions by providing their name and start and end dates.
-   Ability to define an optional, human-readable, and unique URL for the survey.
-   Ability to schedule the automatic opening and closing date for the survey.
-   Moderators manually enter the number of participants for a given competition, which is necessary to measure success metrics.
-   Access to a panel with aggregated and fully anonymous results for each competition separately.
-   The moderator panel presents: average rating for closed-ended questions, percentage completion for open-ended questions, number of competition participants, and number of `completed` and `abandoned` surveys.

## 4. Product boundaries

The following functionalities are intentionally NOT in scope for the MVP:
-   Automatic creation of surveys via integration with the official competition calendar.
-   Integration of the user account system with external authentication services (e.g., Google, Facebook, CIVL).
-   Notification system (email, push) about surveys to fill in or complete.
-   Integration with a safety incident reporting system.
-   Advanced analysis of collected data and generation of extensive reports.
-   Tools for moderators to communicate with survey respondents.
-   A system to verify whether a given user actually participated in the assessed competition.
-   Translation of the application into other languages.

## 6. Success metrics

Key performance indicators (KPIs) for the MVP and ways to measure them:

-   at least 50% of competitors complete the survey after the competition
    -   Measurement method: Comparison of the number of surveys with status `completed` with the number of participants manually entered by the moderator for a given competition.
    -   Formula: `(Number of completed surveys / Number of participants) * 100%`

-   at least 75% of surveys with mandatory fields completed in less than 3 minutes
    -   Measurement method: Analysis of the time difference between the moment the survey starts (first interaction) and the moment it reaches status `completed`.
    -   Formula: `COUNT(surveys WHERE (completion_timestamp - start_timestamp) < 3 minutes) / COUNT(all completed surveys) * 100%`

-   at least 25% of surveys with any optional field filled in
    -   Measurement method: Analysis of the content of surveys with status `completed` to check whether at least one optional field was filled in.
    -   Formula: `COUNT(surveys WHERE at least one optional field is filled in) / COUNT(all completed surveys) * 100%`

-   less than 5% of abandoned surveys without all mandatory fields filled
    -   Measurement method: The ratio of the number of surveys with status `abandoned` to the sum of all started surveys (`completed` + `abandoned`).
    -   Formula: `Number of abandoned surveys / (Number of completed surveys + Number of abandoned surveys) * 100%`
